//Sum Calculation:
//
//byte sum = (byte) a + b;
//The issue lies in the expression (byte) a + b. In Java, when you perform arithmetic operations between byte values, they are promoted to int before the operation is performed.
//So, a + b will be promoted to int, which means the result will be of type int, not byte. The explicit cast (byte) only applies to a, not the entire sum.
//
//Assignment to byte Variable:
//
//Since the result of a + b is an int and you're trying to assign it to a byte variable sum, the compiler will give an error, because you can't assign an int to a byte without casting it explicitly.
//Solution:
//To fix this, you need to cast the result of the addition to byte. However, since the result of a + b might exceed the byte range, it is important to be cautious about overflow.
//
//Hereâ€™s the corrected code:
//public class SumClass {
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        byte a = 40, b = 50;
//        byte sum = (byte) (a + b);  // Cast the result of (a + b) to byte
//        System.out.println(sum);
//    }
//}
